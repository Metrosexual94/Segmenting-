When you read words broken up, it's usually called "segmenting" - which means dividing a word into its individual sounds or syllables, essentially "breaking it up" to decode it while reading. 

Key points about segmenting:

Phonological awareness:

Segmenting is a crucial part of phonological awareness, which is the ability to identify and manipulate the sounds in words. 

Decoding:

When learning to read, segmenting helps children decode words by sounding out each individual sound. 

Syllabication:

Sometimes, "segmenting" can also refer specifically to breaking a word into syllables, depending on the context.
